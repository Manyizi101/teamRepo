Git is a version tracking application

Github is a repository site

____________________________________________________

1. Install git
  https://git-scm.com/downloads
  mac: 'brew install git' ('brew' refers to homebrew, which you need installed before you can use it).
  
2. Prepare a Folder for Tracking
  using terminal, or git bash, go to folder that you want to track
  then in terminal, or git bash, type 'git init' 
  
3. Begin Tracking Files
  'git status' shows which files you are tracking ... currently none
  'git add filename' adds file(s) to track
  
Understanding the Git system
  There are THREE levels
    i) Working Directory - set in step 2 ('git init')
    ii) Staging area - pre-commit area, set in step 3 ('git add')
    iii) Commits - version tracker, next step ('git commit')
  All three levels are stored in a folder within the working directory (which is hidden) called ".git"
  There will be a different ".git" folder in each of the working directories that you choose to track.
    
4. Creating a 'version' of your file
    There are two steps to saving each version (each 'commit')
    i) 'git add filename' (add to 'staging area')
    ii) 'git commit -m "Added Comment" (commit)
    
    You can do this all in one
    'git commit -a -m "Added Comment"' (commits and adds changes in one go)

5. Once you have many versions, you can restore an older version, using
  git checkout 'commit #'
  which leaves you in a 'detached head state', to change the current checkout to the head:
  git reset --hard 'commit #'
  
6. To stop tracking a folder:
  'rm -rf .git'

7. To clone a github repository
  In terminal, or git bash, change to the directory you want the repository to be in
  'git clone "repository url"'
